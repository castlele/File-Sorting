	6. Can be chosen multiple sorting paths and/or paths where to sort to.
	
Close goals:
    1. Make one more swift file:

		b) make possible to choose path of sorting (where to move, how to name dirs, etc.).
	2. Reflex on UI;
	3. Find out how to connect API with UI;
	4. Find out how to allow the programm run background without openning it. 

Steps to achive it:
	1. Read about classes and strucs;
	2. Read about SwiftUI and possibility of using it on macOS;
